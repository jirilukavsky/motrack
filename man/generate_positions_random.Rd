\title{Random object positions}
\usage{
generate_positions_random(n, settings, check_distance = T, border_distance = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Number of objects}

\item{settings}{Basic properties - namely `xlim`, `ylim`,
possibly `min_distance`}

\item{check_distance}{Logical.
The positions are generated until
minimum pairwise distance of `min_distance` is met.}

\item{border_distance}{Distance from arena borders.}
}
\value{
Tibble with `object`, `x` and `y` columns.
}
\description{
The function expects a square arena defined by `xlim` and `ylim` settings.
The objects are placed randomly (uniform distribution sampling) into the arena.
If `check_distance` is `TRUE`, the process is repeated
until the minimum pairwise distance is met.
`border_distance` specifies, whether objects should keep some initial distance
from arena borders. This distance is not meant to be the bouncing distance,
it helps to put objects more together in the beginning.
}
\examples{
# sample positions with no other requirements
pos <- generate_positions_random(8, default_settings())
# when starting positions should be further from borders
pos <- generate_positions_random(8, default_settings(), border_distance = 3)
}
